What is in $v$? Are they going to cause bias on $\beta_1$ estimation?

Would this cause bias in estimating $\beta_1$?

# (individual) Fixed Effects Estimation

+ Including individual (cross-sectional units) dummies (here, it is well represented by `wdid`) in the model

+ This is equivalent to do within-transformation of the data (deviation from the individual means) and then regress deviation on deviation

+ What the within-transformation does is to effectively  divide the observations into groups (wells) and you look at variations .red[within] each of the groups (wells observed over time).

+ Since including individual dummies are equivalent to the within-transformation approach, that means including individual (well) dummies also effectively divides the observations into groups (wells) and you look at variations .red[within] each of the groups (wells observed over time).

.content-box-green[**Question**]

+ Does including individual dummies (well fixed effects) help?

--

+ Does including well-tier dummies (well-tier fixed effects) help? 

--

+ Does including well-tier-hp dummies (well-tier-hp fixed effects) help?

.content-box-green[**Definition**]

Impact (program) evaluation is a field of econometrics that focuses on estimating the impact of a program or event.

<br>

.content-box-green[**Examples**]

+ Groundwater use limit in Nebraska $\Rightarrow$ water use 
+ Technology adoption (soil moisture sensor) $\Rightarrow$ water use 
+ Crop insurance $\Rightarrow$ input use 
+ Job training program $\Rightarrow$ productivty 
+ Food Stamp $\Rightarrow$ health, education, etc

.content-box-red[**Key challenge**]

Most of the programs you are interested in are not randomized.

$\downarrow$ 

Selection Bias (endogeneity problem arising from self-selection into the program)

---
class: middle

.content-box-green[**Gold Standard**]

+ The best (if feasible) way to tackle the problem of selection bias in impact evaluation is randomized experiment, where who gets treated or not is determined randomly (you design a program or experiment and randomize treatment-control assignment)

+ This ensures that the treatment status (dummy variable indicating treated or not) is not correlated with the error term 

<br>

.content-box-green[**Example**]

$y \;\;(\mbox{income}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 program \;\;(\mbox{financial aid}) + u$

, where $E[u|program]=0$ (the program is correlated with the error term). OLS is just fine.

--

<br>

.content-box-red[**Problem**]

Many of the programs are simply not possible to randomize because of financial and/or ethical reasons.

$\downarrow$

We need to use data from an event that happened outside our control.

class: middle

# Natural (Quasi) Experiment 

.content-box-green[**Definition**]

An event or policy change (often a change in government policy) that happens .blue[outside of the control of investigators], which changes the environment in which agents (individuals, families, firms, or cities) operate.

--

<br>

.content-box-green[**Challenges**]

The program is most likely correlated with the error term.

.content-box-green[**Lecture Objectives**]

+ It is hard to sell Approaches 1 and 2

Selecting the right control group is important in DID. If the following conditions are satisfied, it is more plausible that the control and treatment groups would have had the same macro shock $(\alpha_1 = \alpha_0)$ if it were not for the treatment.
